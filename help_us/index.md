<p>Help up us make the meetups better for the people who come every week by sending us your ideas on some awesome topics you want us to cover for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>We're working on pride floats! Simply create a world and decorate it. Floats must be submitted by June 10th to be viewed at the meetup on the 12th. The floats must be no bigger than 10x6 according to the world grid, have no more than 315 objects across 5 kits, and all the diagnostics must be green on the webpage.</p>
<p>Please be sure to share any world you create with Chris so he can review it.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">We have delayed the dedline by a week because of the mantinence that recently happened in Altspace.</span> The new deadline for submissions is now June 17th.</p>
